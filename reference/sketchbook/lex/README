The basic machinery of a lexical-scanner generator. Currently what I'm
interested in is the size of the DFA produced by two different
methods: Brzozowski derivatives like ML-ulex (see "Regular expression
derivatives reexamined") vs. my own fancier version of the Thompson
algorithm followed by the subset construction.

So, we're not going to bother generating C code like Flex or RE2C yet.

Some of the code is copied from ../regex. Not going to worry about
keeping one reusable version of that code yet, either.
