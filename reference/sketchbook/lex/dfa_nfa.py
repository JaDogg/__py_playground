DFAs from NFAs. My immediate goal is to count the DFA states produced
from vanilla NFA building vs. memoized. We find that memoization does
reduce the state count on the example from "Regular-expression
derivatives reexamined". It probably won't do as well as DFAs via
derivatives, since we don't use all the simplification rules; but it
did improve on naive Thompson NFA->DFA here.

TODO:
Memoization coalesces states that act like equivalent suffixes of a
regex, but it doesn't help with common prefixes. We could catch those
too with a second pass that takes the NFA and builds a reversed NFA,
memoizing in the same way. (Right?) If we take this approach, it'd
make sense for the first pass to go left to right (instead of the
current right-to-left) so that after the second pass the arrows point
forwards.

Simple example input this should help with:

    hello|hellward|awkward|jello

What's a good more-complex example including loops?

(Would it be just as good, and easier, to do this bidirectional
memoizing at the regex level and then just NFAify in one pass as
before?)

So, like this? (but memoized) --

reverse rk AcceptingNode       = rk
reverse rk (ExpectingNode n k) = reverse k (ExpectingNode n rk)
reverse rk (ForkNode k1 k2)    = reverse rk k1 `fork` reverse rk k2
reverse rk (LoopNode k makeK) = loop where
                                loop = LoopNode (reverse rk k)
                                                (reverse loop (makeK AcceptingNode))
