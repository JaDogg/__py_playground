# Produce keys from a file on stdin, to stdout.

# For some godforsaken reason "tr A-Za-z" does not actually give us
# just the alphabetic ASCII characters, at least here in OS X, while
# setting LOCALE to C and specifying [:alpha:] *does*. We need some
# such restriction because our keys appear directly as filenames, and
# the equally godforsaken filesystem chokes on strange UTF8
# characters.

export LOCALE=C

tr -cs '[:alpha:]' '\n' |		# get alphanumeric 'words'
 cat -v |				# work around stupid tr bug
 grep -v '^$' |				# drop blank lines
 tr A-Z a-z |				# fold case
 sort -u				# uniquify
