In ../simplest we represent an index as a directory, one file per
key. That was, alas, costly, at least in OS X -- so let's try a tar
file for the index.

While we're tuning things, let's remove the worst redundancy: in
../simplest each word's list of documents was just a list of
filenames. By encoding them as (decimal) numeric docids, those lists
get much much smaller. The docids then must be mapped to filenames --
this info appears as a new subdirectory in the tar file.

Unfortunately, the tar format turns out to be way too fat for
this. Not as wasteful as an OS X directory, but, still, in my test
70MB of text turns into 100MB of tarred index. (With gzip, that
becomes about 3MB, or 5% of the size of the documents; but then search
time gets kind of painful. It's already pretty bad even uncompressed.)
