; During execution of the code produced by the compiler, two lists
; (named CLIST and NLIST) are maintained by the subroutines CNODE and
; NNODE.  CLIST contains a list of TSX **,2 instructions terminated by
; a TRA XCHG.  Each TSX represents a partial match of the regular
; expression and the TRA XCHG represents the end of the list of
; possible matches.

; Initialization is required to set up the initial lists and start the
; first character.

; XCHG is transferred to when the current list is exhausted.  This
; routine copies NLIST onto CLIST, appends a JUMP ,,XCHG instruction,
; gets a new character in r1, and transfers to CLIST.
; The instruction JUMP r2,,CODE is also executed to start a new search of
; the entire regular expression with each character.  Thus the regular
; expression will be found anywhere in the text to be searched.
