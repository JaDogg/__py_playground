-- I'm going to assume Empty never appears in an re input to matches.
-- Empty is meant only to be introduced internally, and immediately
-- dropped on combination with any other RE. (We never form new REs
-- internally except by Seq, which has Empty as its identity element.)

-- we return a list of re's instead of an re.
